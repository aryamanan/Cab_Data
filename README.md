## Cab Data Analysis: Project Overview

Here's a concise overview of the steps undertaken and the findings derived from the analysis.

**Project Scope:**
The project involves a detailed exploration of taxi cab data to gain insights into the performance of two prominent cab companies: Yellow Cab and Pink Cab. The primary objectives were to evaluate their profitability, customer reach, and geographical presence.

**Data Collection and Processing:**

CSV files from the data folder were loaded, containing essential information about cab rides.
The collected data was consolidated into a single Excel file, named "full_data.xlsx," to facilitate efficient visualization and analysis.

**Analysis Tools:**

Microsoft Power BI was employed to create insightful visualizations and dashboards for easy data interpretation. Alternatively, Tableau could also be used for visualization.
Visualizations were generated to illustrate key trends and patterns in the data, providing a clear view of the companies' performance.

**Visualizations:**

Visualizations showcasing different aspects of the data were created and stored in the "img" folder.
A Microsoft Power BI file, "taxi_cabs_visualization.pbix," was developed to provide an interactive platform for exploring the data.

Python programming was utilized for more in-depth analysis.
The "eda_notebook.ipynb" notebook contains Python code that delves into data exploration, generating additional insights.
A variety of plots were created and stored in the "plots" folder, offering a comprehensive view of various data aspects.

## Key Findings and Conclusions:**
After thorough analysis and observations, the following conclusions were drawn:

**Company Preference:**
Yellow Cab emerged as the preferred choice for investment due to various factors.
It demonstrated a broader customer base across genders compared to Pink Cab.
Yellow Cab exhibited a higher profit margin and lower loss margin compared to Pink Cab.

As the price charged increased, Yellow Cab's profit growth outpaced Pink Cab's.
Yellow Cab consistently maintained a higher transaction margin on a yearly and monthly basis.
Geographical Insights:

**Recommendation:**
Although Yellow Cab dominated key cities like New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles, it's recommended to expand its presence in Miami, Silicon Valley, and Orange County to maximize profitability.

To further solidify its position, Yellow Cab should consider enhancing its services and offers in order to attract a wider customer base.
By analyzing specific factors influencing customer preferences, Yellow Cab can tailor its strategies to tap into untapped markets effectively.

In summary, the comprehensive analysis of taxi cab data underscores Yellow Cab's superior performance in terms of profitability, customer reach, and geographical coverage. This overview encapsulates the project's objectives, methods, findings, and actionable recommendations, all of which can be elaborated upon in an interview setting.
